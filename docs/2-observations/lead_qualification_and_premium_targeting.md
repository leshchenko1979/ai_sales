# Tracking Qualification Criteria Responses

## Current Implementation Issues

Currently there is no reliable mechanism to track and store responses to qualification criteria questions during sales conversations. This makes it difficult to:

1. Know which qualification questions have already been asked
2. Remember and analyze the responses
3. Make data-driven decisions about lead qualification
4. Generate accurate reports on lead qualification rates

## Proposed Solution

The advisor role should be responsible for:

1. Tracking which qualification questions have been asked
2. Extracting and storing responses from the conversation history
3. Maintaining this information in the conductor's memory between turns
4. Providing qualification status updates to the manager role

### Implementation Details

The advisor should:

1. Parse conversation history for responses to key qualification criteria:
   - Investment amount capability
   - Investment timeline
   - Engagement level

2. Store extracted data in a structured format in conductor memory:

```python
qualification_data = {
    "investment_amount": {
        "asked": bool,
        "response": str,
        "qualified": bool
    },
    "timeline": {
        "asked": bool,
        "response": str,
        "qualified": bool
    },
    "engagement": {
        "asked": bool,
        "response": str,
        "qualified": bool
    }
}
```

3. Include qualification status in advisor output:

```
QUALIFICATION_STATUS: {
    "complete": false,
    "qualified": null,
    "missing_criteria": ["investment_amount", "timeline"]
}
```

This will enable:
- More systematic qualification process
- Better tracking of qualification status
- Data-driven qualification decisions
- Accurate reporting on qualification rates

## Additional Opportunities

### Premium Residential Chat Analysis
We can extend qualification criteria parsing to chats of premium residential complexes to:

1. Identify potential investors among residents of high-end properties:
   - Business class residential complexes
   - Elite housing communities
   - Premium suburban developments

2. Analyze common investment interests and concerns in wealthy communities

3. Build targeted audiences based on:
   - Property ownership patterns (focus on premium real estate owners)
   - Investment discussions
   - Financial capability signals
   - Lifestyle markers indicating high net worth

4. Generate leads from existing affluent communities

This would provide:
- Pre-qualified prospects with proven purchasing power
- Higher conversion potential due to existing investment experience
- Better targeting data from premium market segment
- Access to networks of high-net-worth individuals
- Community-based marketing opportunities in wealthy neighborhoods
